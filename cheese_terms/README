mongodb + twitter + yahoo term extractor = fun!

an experiment in using yahoo term extraction to extract terms from tweets about cheese
uses mongodb as the datastore

-- general setup

bash> mongod & # ie start mongo
bash> export APPID=sdkfskdjfnsd # yahoo appid

-- populate db

if you have some saved tweets somewhere
bash> time zcat /data/twitter/gardenhose/cheese.20100128.json.gz | ./insert_into_mongo.rb
7s for 14k records

of if you just want a sample of random ones to start with
bash> curl -s -u twitter_userid:twitter_password http://stream.twitter.com/1/statuses/sample.json | tee ./insert_into_mongo.rb

-- augment saved tweets with terms as specified by yahoo place maker

runs as fast as possible, sleeps 1m if error (eg rate limit exceeded)
bash> ./update_mongo.rb

eg augments a tweet of 

{ :text => 'Home from the Walmart--fridge and cupboards are full. Boy 1 is worse. Boy 2 is better. Making grilled cheese and tom soup for dinner. Lame.' }

to include

{ :text_terms => ["grilled cheese", "cupboards", "walmart", "fridge", "cheese soup"] }


to see how many you've done 
irb> require 'rubygems'
irb> require 'mongo'
irb> mongo = Mongo::Connection.new
irb> db = mongo.db 'tweets'
irb> col = db['tweets']
irb> col.count 
13953 # ie this many tweets in total
irb> col.find({'has_tweet_terms' => true}).count
5305 # have termified this many so far

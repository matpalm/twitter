collect tweets with...
$ ./collect.rb >> search_results.json

from time to time, leaving it as long as you can
(it keeps where it's up to in a file called collect_progress)

to swap output file out wait until it's on a REFRESH and run
$ cp search_results.json search_results.old.json; :> search_results.json

-----------------------------

load into mongo with...
(this handles dedupping)

1) kill running slurp
2) run
$ ./load_latest_into_mongo.sh
3) as soon as it's started restart slurp

TODO: all this in one script

-------------------------------

if a schema change is ever made for load_into_mongo.rb
we can catch up the existing documents with a call to update_existing_documents.rb

irb> require 'rubygems'; require 'mongo'; mongo = Mongo::Connection.new;db = mongo.db 'tweets';col = db['tweets']

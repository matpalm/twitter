collect tweets with...
$ ./collect.rb >> search_results.json

from time to time, leaving it as long as you can
(it keeps where it's up to in a file called collect_progress)

to swap output file out wait until it's on a REFRESH and run
$ cp search_results.json search_results.old.json; :> search_results.json

-----------------------------

load into mongo with...
(this handles dedupping)
$ ./load_into_mongo.rb < search_results.old.json

can then ditch tweets.old (or archive off if your paranoid)

-------------------------------

analysing the tweets can be done with...



$ cat world_cup_2.1.tweets | extract_tweets_from_search_results.rb | min_max_dates.rb

to show min/max of tweets

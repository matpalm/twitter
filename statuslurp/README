simple status slurper
requires beanstalkd

get a list of tids
eg: mysql tgraph < slurp.sql | grep -v tids > ids

bash> beanstalkd &

bash> export UID_PWD=mat_kelcey:PASSWORDGOESHERE 
bash> ./queuer < ids &
bash> ./fetcher 10 

wtf is happening? 
queuer checks rate limit of twitter and fills queue with whatever capacity is allowed until reset
fetchers read off queue and do the fetch spewing out to a file

TODOS: 

change to event machine; only because it'd be interesting to learn. my api limit means is the bottleneck, not calling curl
